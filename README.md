# OpenWebUI Conversation

The OpenWebUI integration adds a conversation agent powered by [OpenWebUI][openwebui] in Home Assistant.

This conversation agent is unable to control your house. The OpenWebUI conversation agent can be used in automations, but not as a [sentence trigger][sentence-trigger]. It can only query information that has been provided by Home Assistant. To be able to answer questions about your house, Home Assistant will need to provide OpenWebUI with the details of your house, which include areas, devices and their states.
